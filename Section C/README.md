# isbn

Dependencies
Program uses the libraries numpy and unittest.

Runtime
Program can be excuted using any playform that accepts python files (i.e Pycharm, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code etc).

Space Complexity
The space complexity is linear. The functions isbn13(isbn) accepts a string and both checkIsbn13(isbn) and stringIsbn13(isbn13) accept a list. Memory will have to be allocated for the input variables, variables created in the program and output variables. In most cases, the program assigns expressions to variables already in memory. During the execution of the program there are some function calls and for loops which would fall under the auxillary space but the space complexity is still linear.
